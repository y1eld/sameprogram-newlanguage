# the project

1. i make the same program in different programming languages.
2. i make a repository for it
3. that's it.

## following up on number 2
chatgpt sucks and that's the conclusion.
i tried to make the description of this repository and failed horribly.

example: <br>
<img src="https://github.com/y1eld/sameprogram-newlanguage/assets/141585498/74c15d37-5112-40f8-8e14-d3371b646e40" alt="image" width="300"><br>
also this is not my photo.

"i need a basic description of my repository"
legit gave me the entire declaration of independence and talked like a 6 subscriber shit png tuber getting excited and making
an entire video about the new discord server of the channel opening up
